# 🌦️ Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains my **Weather Prediction ML project**, developed during a **2-month remote internship at Next Chapter Skills**.  
The goal was to build a machine learning model that predicts weather conditions using real-world historical weather data.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- ✅ Achieved **90%+ accuracy** (exact test accuracy: X.XX%)  
- ✅ Processed **10,000+ weather records** using **Pandas** & **Scikit-learn**  
- ✅ Implemented **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training**  
- ✅ Visualized patterns & model performance with **Matplotlib** (5+ graphs)  
- ✅ Deployed reproducible Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks
